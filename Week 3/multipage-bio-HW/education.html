                <h3 class="fancy border" >About Me :]</h3>
                <p>It took years to figure out me. So when I see an about me section my thoughts always go really deep. To tell you about me is to go on an ugly journey of self discovery. To experience all the things upleasant and to eventually see how life circles around until you realize you have go learn from this similar experience that keeps happening to you. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    I think to know me is to know that nature helps me collect my thougths. If I go out for a hike, the noise of cars and electronics goes away and I can take the time to clear all the crazy energy away leaving me to be me. To know me. To make space to create more of what I want from life.
                    <br><br><br>
                    I can tell you that I'm a mom of two, but that doesn't define me. Anyone can be a parent of two. I am a leader. I lead by example, even if the example isn't followed. I make sacrifices for the lives I am responsible for. I create space for my children to grow and make mistakes. Most of all I love. I have discovered that there truly is no bigger love than the love I feel for my children. In turn, I am unconditionally loved too.
